// There is a building consisting of 10 000 apartments numbered from 1 to 10 000,
// inclusive.

// Call an apartment boring, if its number consists of the same digit. Examples
// of boring apartments are 11,2,777,9999 and so on.

// Our character is a troublemaker, and he calls the intercoms of all boring
// apartments, till someone answers the call, in the following order:

// First he calls all apartments consisting of digit 1, in increasing order
// (1,11,111,1111). Next he calls all apartments consisting of digit 2, in
// increasing order (2,22,222,2222) And so on. The resident of the boring
// apartment x answers the call, and our character stops calling anyone
// further.

// Our character wants to know how many digits he pressed in total and your task
// is to help him to count the total number of keypresses.

// For example, if the resident of boring apartment 22 answered, then our
// character called apartments with numbers 1,11,111,1111,2,22 and the total
// number of digits he pressed is 1+2+3+4+1+2=13.

// You have to answer t independent test cases.
