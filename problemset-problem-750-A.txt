// Limak is going to participate in a contest on the last day of the 2016. The
// contest will start at 20:00 and will last four hours, exactly until midnight.
// There will be n problems, sorted by difficulty, i.e. problem 1 is the easiest
// and problem n is the hardest. Limak knows it will take him 5Â·i minutes to
// solve the i-th problem.

// Limak's friends organize a New Year's Eve party and Limak wants to be there at
// midnight or earlier. He needs k minutes to get there from his house, where he
// will participate in the contest first.

// How many problems can Limak solve if he wants to make it to the party?
