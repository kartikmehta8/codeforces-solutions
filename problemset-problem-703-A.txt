// Mishka is a little polar bear. As known, little bears loves spending their
// free time playing dice for chocolates. Once in a wonderful sunny morning,
// walking around blocks of ice, Mishka met her friend Chris, and they started
// playing the game.

// Rules of the game are very simple: at first number of rounds n is defined. In
// every round each of the players throws a cubical dice with distinct numbers
// from 1 to 6 written on its faces. Player, whose value after throwing the dice
// is greater, wins the round. In case if player dice values are equal, no one
// of them is a winner.

// In average, player, who won most of the rounds, is the winner of the game. In
// case if two players won the same number of rounds, the result of the game is
// draw.

// Mishka is still very little and can't count wins and losses, so she asked you
// to watch their game and determine its result. Please help her!
