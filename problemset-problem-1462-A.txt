// Polycarp has a favorite sequence a[1…n] consisting of n integers. He wrote it
// out on the whiteboard as follows:

// he wrote the number a1 to the left side (at the beginning of the whiteboard);
// he wrote the number a2 to the right side (at the end of the whiteboard); then
// as far to the left as possible (but to the right from a1), he wrote the
// number a3; then as far to the right as possible (but to the left from a2), he
// wrote the number a4; Polycarp continued to act as well, until he wrote out
// the entire sequence on the whiteboard. The beginning of the result looks like
// this (of course, if n≥4). For example, if n=7 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2], then
// Polycarp will write a sequence on the whiteboard [3,4,5,2,9,1,1].

// You saw the sequence written on the whiteboard and now you want to restore
// Polycarp's favorite sequence.
