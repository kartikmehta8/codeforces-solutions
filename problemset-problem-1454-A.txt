// You are given one integer n (n>1).

// Recall that a permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
// integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
// permutation of length 5, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in
// the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the
// array).

// Your task is to find a permutation p of length n that there is no index i
// (1≤i≤n) such that pi=i (so, for all i from 1 to n the condition pi≠i should
// be satisfied).

// You have to answer t independent test cases.

// If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the
// answer exists for each n>1.
