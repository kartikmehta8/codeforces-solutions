// Polycarp urgently needs a shovel! He comes to the shop and chooses an
// appropriate one. The shovel that Policarp chooses is sold for k burles.
// Assume that there is an unlimited number of such shovels in the shop.

// In his pocket Polycarp has an unlimited number of "10-burle coins" and exactly
// one coin of r burles (1 ≤ r ≤ 9).

// What is the minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay
// for the purchase without any change? It is obvious that he can pay for 10
// shovels without any change (by paying the requied amount of 10-burle coins
// and not using the coin of r burles). But perhaps he can buy fewer shovels and
// pay without any change. Note that Polycarp should buy at least one shovel.
