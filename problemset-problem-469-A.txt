// There is a game called "I Wanna Be the Guy", consisting of n levels. Little X
// and his friend Little Y are addicted to the game. Each of them wants to pass
// the whole game.

// Little X can pass only p levels of the game. And Little Y can pass only q
// levels of the game. You are given the indices of levels Little X can pass and
// the indices of levels Little Y can pass. Will Little X and Little Y pass the
// whole game, if they cooperate each other?
