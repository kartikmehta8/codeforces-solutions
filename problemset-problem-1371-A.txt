// A penguin Rocher has n sticks. He has exactly one stick with length i for all
// 1≤i≤n.

// He can connect some sticks. If he connects two sticks that have lengths a and
// b, he gets one stick with length a+b. Two sticks, that were used in the
// operation disappear from his set and the new connected stick appears in his
// set and can be used for the next connections.

// He wants to create the maximum number of sticks that have the same length. It
// is not necessary to make all sticks have the same length, some sticks can
// have the other length. How many sticks with the equal length he can create?
