// Fafa owns a company that works on huge projects. There are n employees in
// Fafa's company. Whenever the company has a new project to start working on,
// Fafa has to divide the tasks of this project among all the employees.

// Fafa finds doing this every time is very tiring for him. So, he decided to
// choose the best l employees in his company as team leaders. Whenever there is
// a new project, Fafa will divide the tasks among only the team leaders and
// each team leader will be responsible of some positive number of employees to
// give them the tasks. To make this process fair for the team leaders, each one
// of them should be responsible for the same number of employees. Moreover,
// every employee, who is not a team leader, has to be under the responsibility
// of exactly one team leader, and no team leader is responsible for another
// team leader.

// Given the number of employees n, find in how many ways Fafa could choose the
// number of team leaders l in such a way that it is possible to divide
// employees between them evenly.
