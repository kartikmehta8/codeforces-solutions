// Four players participate in the playoff tournament. The tournament is held
// according to the following scheme: the first player will play with the
// second, and the third player with the fourth, then the winners of the pairs
// will play in the finals of the tournament.

// It is known that in a match between two players, the one whose skill is
// greater will win. The skill of the i-th player is equal to si and all skill
// levels are pairwise different (i.â€‰e. there are no two identical values in the
// array s).

// The tournament is called fair if the two players with the highest skills meet
// in the finals.

// Determine whether the given tournament is fair.
