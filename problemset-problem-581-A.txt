// One day Vasya the Hipster decided to count how many socks he had. It turned
// out that he had a red socks and b blue socks.

// According to the latest fashion, hipsters should wear the socks of different
// colors: a red one on the left foot, a blue one on the right foot.

// Every day Vasya puts on new socks in the morning and throws them away before
// going to bed as he doesn't want to wash them.

// Vasya wonders, what is the maximum number of days when he can dress
// fashionable and wear different socks, and after that, for how many days he
// can then wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make
// a single pair from the socks he's got.

// Can you help him?
