// «One dragon. Two dragon. Three dragon», — the princess was counting. She had
//  trouble falling asleep, and she got bored of counting lambs when she was
//  nine.

// However, just counting dragons was boring as well, so she entertained herself
// at best she could. Tonight she imagined that all dragons were here to steal
// her, and she was fighting them off. Every k-th dragon got punched in the face
// with a frying pan. Every l-th dragon got his tail shut into the balcony door.
// Every m-th dragon got his paws trampled with sharp heels. Finally, she
// threatened every n-th dragon to call her mom, and he withdrew in panic.

// How many imaginary dragons suffered moral or physical damage tonight, if the
// princess counted a total of d dragons?
