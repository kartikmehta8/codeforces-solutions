// Vanya and his friends are walking along the fence of height h and they do not
// want the guard to notice them. In order to achieve this the height of each of
// the friends should not exceed h. If the height of some person is greater than
// h he can bend down and then he surely won't be noticed by the guard. The
// height of the i-th person is equal to ai.

// Consider the width of the person walking as usual to be equal to 1, while the
// width of the bent person is equal to 2. Friends want to talk to each other
// while walking, so they would like to walk in a single row. What is the
// minimum width of the road, such that friends can walk in a row and remain
// unattended by the guard?
