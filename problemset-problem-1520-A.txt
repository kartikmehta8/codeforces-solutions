// Polycarp has 26 tasks. Each task is designated by a capital letter of the
// Latin alphabet.

// The teacher asked Polycarp to solve tasks in the following way: if Polycarp
// began to solve some task, then he must solve it to the end, without being
// distracted by another task. After switching to another task, Polycarp cannot
// return to the previous task.

// Polycarp can only solve one task during the day. Every day he wrote down what
// task he solved. Now the teacher wants to know if Polycarp followed his
// advice.

// For example, if Polycarp solved tasks in the following order: "DDBBCCCBBEZ",
// then the teacher will see that on the third day Polycarp began to solve the
// task 'B', then on the fifth day he got distracted and began to solve the
// task 'C', on the eighth day Polycarp returned to the task 'B'. Other examples
// of when the teacher is suspicious: "BAB", "AABBCCDDEEBZZ" and "AAAAZAAAAA".

// If Polycarp solved the tasks as follows: "FFGZZZY", then the teacher cannot
// have any suspicions. Please note that Polycarp is not obligated to solve all
// tasks. Other examples of when the teacher doesn't have any
// suspicious: "BA", "AFFFCC" and "YYYYY".

// Help Polycarp find out if his teacher might be suspicious.
