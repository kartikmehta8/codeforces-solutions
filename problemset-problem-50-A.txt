// You are given a rectangular board of M × N squares. Also you are given an
// unlimited number of standard domino pieces of 2 × 1 squares. You are allowed
// to rotate the pieces. You are asked to place as many dominoes as possible on
// the board so as to meet the following conditions:

// 1. Each domino completely covers two squares.

// 2. No two dominoes overlap.

// 3. Each domino lies entirely inside the board. It is allowed to touch the edges of the board.

// Find the maximum number of dominoes, which can be placed under these restrictions.
