// Yakko, Wakko and Dot, world-famous animaniacs, decided to rest from acting in
// cartoons, and take a leave to travel a bit. Yakko dreamt to go to
// Pennsylvania, his Motherland and the Motherland of his ancestors. Wakko
// thought about Tasmania, its beaches, sun and sea. Dot chose Transylvania as
// the most mysterious and unpredictable place.

// But to their great regret, the leave turned to be very short, so it will be
// enough to visit one of the three above named places. That's why Yakko, as the
// cleverest, came up with a truly genius idea: let each of the three roll an
// ordinary six-sided die, and the one with the highest amount of points will be
// the winner, and will take the other two to the place of his/her dreams.

// Yakko thrown a die and got Y points, Wakko â€” W points. It was Dot's turn. But
// she didn't hurry. Dot wanted to know for sure what were her chances to visit
// Transylvania.

// It is known that Yakko and Wakko are true gentlemen, that's why if they have
// the same amount of points with Dot, they will let Dot win.
