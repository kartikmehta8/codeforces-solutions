// Lee is going to fashionably decorate his house for a party, using some regular
// convex polygons...

// Lee thinks a regular n-sided (convex) polygon is beautiful if and only if he
// can rotate it in such a way that at least one of its edges is parallel to the
// OX-axis and at least one of its edges is parallel to the OY-axis at the same
// time.

// Recall that a regular n-sided polygon is a convex polygon with n vertices such
// that all the edges and angles are equal.

// Now he is shopping: the market has t regular polygons. For each of them print
// YES if it is beautiful and NO otherwise.
