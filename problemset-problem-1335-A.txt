// There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have n candies. You want to
// distribute these n candies between two sisters in such a way that:

// Alice will get a (a>0) candies; Betty will get b (b>0) candies; each sister
// will get some integer number of candies; Alice will get a greater amount of
// candies than Betty (i.e. a>b); all the candies will be given to one of two
// sisters (i.e. a+b=n). Your task is to calculate the number of ways to
// distribute exactly n candies between sisters in a way described above.
// Candies are indistinguishable.

// Formally, find the number of ways to represent n as the sum of n=a+b, where a
// and b are positive integers and a>b.

// You have to answer t independent test cases.
