// Recently, Anton has found a set. The set consists of small English letters.
// Anton carefully wrote out all the letters from the set in one line, separated
// by a comma. He also added an opening curved bracket at the beginning of the
// line and a closing curved bracket at the end of the line.

// Unfortunately, from time to time Anton would forget writing some letter and
// write it again. He asks you to count the total number of distinct letters in
// his set.
