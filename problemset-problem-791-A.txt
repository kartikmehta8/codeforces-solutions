// Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger
// than his brother Bob.

// Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that
// Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

// Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's
// weight is doubled after every year.

// After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier)
// than Bob?
