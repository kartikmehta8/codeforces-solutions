// Mad scientist Mike entertains himself by arranging rows of dominoes. He
// doesn't need dominoes, though: he uses rectangular magnets instead. Each
// magnet has two poles, positive (a "plus") and negative (a "minus"). If two
// magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel
// each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.

// Mike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each
// following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the
// row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either
// attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked
// together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to
// the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to
// others forms a group of its own.


// Mike arranged multiple magnets in a row. Determine the number of groups that
// the magnets formed.
