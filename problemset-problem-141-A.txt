// So, the New Year holidays are over. Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a
// rest and have guests at last. When two "New Year and Christmas Men" meet,
// thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and
// the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the
// main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the
// letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and
// put them in one pile in front of the door.

// The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the
// disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names
// of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we
// need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to
// cut more letters.

// Help the "New Year and Christmas Men" and their friends to cope with this
// problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the
// previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next
// morning.
