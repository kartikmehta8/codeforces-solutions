// Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long
// that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

// Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10
// characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special
// abbreviation.

// This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last
// letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the
// first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't
// contain any leading zeroes.

// Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalizationÂ» will be spelt as "i18n".

// You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with
// abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the
// abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any
// changes.
