// Alice guesses the strings that Bob made for her.

// At first, Bob came up with the secret string a consisting of lowercase English
// letters. The string a has a length of 2 or more characters. Then, from string
// a he builds a new string b and offers Alice the string b so that she can
// guess the string a.

// Bob builds b from a as follows: he writes all the substrings of length 2 of
// the string a in the order from left to right, and then joins them in the same
// order into the string b.

// For example, if Bob came up with the string a="abac", then all the substrings
// of length 2 of the string a are: "ab", "ba", "ac". Therefore, the string
// b="abbaac".

// You are given the string b. Help Alice to guess the string a that Bob came up
// with. It is guaranteed that b was built according to the algorithm given
// above. It can be proved that the answer to the problem is unique.
