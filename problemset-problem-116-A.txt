// Linear Kingdom has exactly one tram line. It has n stops, numbered from 1 to n
// in the order of tram's movement. At the i-th stop ai passengers exit the
// tram, while bi passengers enter it. The tram is empty before it arrives at
// the first stop. Also, when the tram arrives at the last stop, all passengers
// exit so that it becomes empty.

// Your task is to calculate the tram's minimum capacity such that the number of
// people inside the tram at any time never exceeds this capacity. Note that at
// each stop all exiting passengers exit before any entering passenger enters
// the tram.
