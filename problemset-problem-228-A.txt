// Valera the Horse is going to the party with friends. He has been following the
// fashion trends for a while, and he knows that it is very popular to wear all
// horseshoes of different color. Valera has got four horseshoes left from the
// last year, but maybe some of them have the same color. In this case he needs
// to go to the store and buy some few more horseshoes, not to lose face in
// front of his stylish comrades.

// Fortunately, the store sells horseshoes of all colors under the sun and Valera
// has enough money to buy any four of them. However, in order to save the
// money, he would like to spend as little money as possible, so you need to
// help Valera and determine what is the minimum number of horseshoes he needs
// to buy to wear four horseshoes of different colors to a party.
