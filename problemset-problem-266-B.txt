// During the break the schoolchildren, boys and girls, formed a queue of n
// people in the canteen. Initially the children stood in the order they entered
// the canteen. However, after a while the boys started feeling awkward for
// standing in front of the girls in the queue and they started letting the
// girls move forward each second.

// Let's describe the process more precisely. Let's say that the positions in the
// queue are sequentially numbered by integers from 1 to n, at that the person
// in the position number 1 is served first. Then, if at time x a boy stands on
// the i-th position and a girl stands on the (i + 1)-th position, then at time
// x + 1 the i-th position will have a girl and the (i + 1)-th position will
// have a boy. The time is given in seconds.

// You've got the initial position of the children, at the initial moment of
// time. Determine the way the queue is going to look after t seconds.
