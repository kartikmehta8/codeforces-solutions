// New Year is coming and you are excited to know how many minutes remain before

// where 0≤hh<24 and 0≤mm<60. We use 24-hour time format!

// Your task is to find the number of minutes before the New Year. You know that
// New Year comes when the clock shows 0 hours and 0 minutes.

// You have to answer t independent test cases.
