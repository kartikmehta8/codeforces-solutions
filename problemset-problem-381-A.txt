// Sereja and Dima play a game. The rules of the game are very simple. The
// players have n cards in a row. Each card contains a number, all numbers on
// the cards are distinct. The players take turns, Sereja moves first. During
// his turn a player can take one card: either the leftmost card in a row, or
// the rightmost one. The game ends when there is no more cards. The player who
// has the maximum sum of numbers on his cards by the end of the game, wins.

// Sereja and Dima are being greedy. Each of them chooses the card with the
// larger number during his move.

// Inna is a friend of Sereja and Dima. She knows which strategy the guys are
// using, so she wants to determine the final score, given the initial state of
// the game. Help her.
