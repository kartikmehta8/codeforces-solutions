// One day three best friends Petya, Vasya and Tonya decided to form a team and
// take part in programming contests. Participants are usually offered several
// problems during programming contests. Long before the start the friends
// decided that they will implement a problem if at least two of them are sure
// about the solution. Otherwise, the friends won't write the problem's
// solution.

// This contest offers n problems to the participants. For each problem we know,
// which friend is sure about the solution. Help the friends find the number of
// problems for which they will write a solution.
