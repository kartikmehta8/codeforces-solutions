// Little Petya very much likes gifts. Recently he has received a new laptop as a
// New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody
// else as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts. And on this
// occasion he organized a New Year party at his place and invited n his friends
// there.

// If there's one thing Petya likes more that receiving gifts, that's watching
// others giving gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until
// the next New Year and made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts
// while he does not participate in the process. He numbered all his friends
// with integers from 1 to n. Petya remembered that a friend number i gave a
// gift to a friend number pi. He also remembered that each of his friends
// received exactly one gift.

// Now Petya wants to know for each friend i the number of a friend who has given
// him a gift.
