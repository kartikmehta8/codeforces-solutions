// When preparing a tournament, Codeforces coordinators try treir best to make
// the first problem as easy as possible. This time the coordinator had chosen
// some problem and asked n people about their opinions. Each person answered
// whether this problem is easy or hard.

// If at least one of these n people has answered that the problem is hard, the
// coordinator decides to change the problem. For the given responses, check if
// the problem is easy enough.
