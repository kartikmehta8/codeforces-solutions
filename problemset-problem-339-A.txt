// Xenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school.
// She is now learning the addition operation.

// The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should
// calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains
// numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning
// to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in
// non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she
// can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.

// You've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and
// print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.
