// Dr. Bruce Banner hates his enemies (like others don't). As we all know, he can
// barely talk when he turns into the incredible Hulk. That's why he asked you
// to help him to express his feelings.

// Hulk likes the Inception so much, and like that his feelings are complicated.
// They have n layers. The first layer is hate, second one is love, third one is
// hate and so on...

// For example if n = 1, then his feeling is "I hate it" or if n = 2 it's "I hate
// that I love it", and if n = 3 it's "I hate that I love that I hate it" and so
// on.
