// Little Vasya loves orange juice very much. That's why any food and drink in
// his kitchen necessarily contains orange juice. There are n drinks in his
// fridge, the volume fraction of orange juice in the i-th drink equals pi
// percent.

// One day Vasya decided to make himself an orange cocktail. He took equal
// proportions of each of the n drinks and mixed them. Then he wondered, how
// much orange juice the cocktail has.

// Find the volume fraction of orange juice in the final drink.
