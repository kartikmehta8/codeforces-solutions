// Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it
// is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year,
// our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so).
// After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the
// network.

// But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is
// actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love
// again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user
// names.

// This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is
// odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string
// that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of
// this user by his method.
