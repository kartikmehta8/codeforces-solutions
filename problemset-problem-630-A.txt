// The HR manager was disappointed again. The last applicant failed the interview
// the same way as 24 previous ones. "Do I give such a hard task?" â€” the HR
// manager thought. "Just raise number 5 to the power of n and get last two
// digits of the number. Yes, of course, n can be rather big, and one cannot
// find the power using a calculator, but we need people who are able to think,
// not just follow the instructions."
